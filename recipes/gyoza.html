    <h2>Ingredients</h2>  

    <p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
  <li>200 g of flour</li>
  <li>15 cl of boiling water</li>
  <li>Potato starch to prevent the dough from sticking when rolled</li>
</ul>

<p>For the filling:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (canola)</li>
  <li>A pinch of salt</li>
  <li>100 g of minced pork</li>
  <li>200 g of raw, peeled, and chopped shrimp</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong></li>
    <h3>Preparing the Dough:</h3>
    <p>Place the flour in a bowl, add boiling water, and mix well with chopsticks or a fork.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong></li>
    <p>Once the mixture is slightly cooler, knead for 5 minutes to obtain a perfectly homogeneous dough. Form a ball and let it rest for 1 hour at room temperature.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong></li>
    <h3>Preparing the Filling:</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, combine pork, shrimp, a pinch of salt, and oil. Mix thoroughly until the mixture is sticky.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong></li>
    <p>Add the "A" preparation and nira/chives, mix well.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong></li>
    <p>Dust the work surface with potato starch.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong></li>
    <p>Divide the dough ball into 8 equal parts. Shape 8 regular rolls of about 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut each roll into slices about 1.5 cm wide, resulting in pieces of approximately 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm, from which you make small balls.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 7:</strong></li>
    <p>Roll out each ball with a rolling pin to get (almost) perfect and (almost) transparent circles (about 10 cm in diameter). It's important to flour each circle well to prevent sticking.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 8:</strong></li>
    <p>Place 1 teaspoon of filling on each circle, moisten the edges with a little water, and shape your gyoza. If the traditional shape is too difficult to achieve, simply fold them neatly in half; it will look better than a clumsy attempt.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 9:</strong></li>
    <p>These gyoza can be cooked in two ways:</p>

    <li><strong>Step 10:</strong></li>
    <p>As dumplings, cook for a few minutes in boiling water or broth. When they become transparent, they are ready. Drain and serve quickly (drizzling with a hint of broth helps prevent sticking).</p>
    <p>In a pan: heat a little canola oil in the pan. Arrange the gyoza next to each other in rows. Let them grill for 2 minutes, then add a glass of water and cover the pan. The water will evaporate and finish cooking the gyoza with steam. It is customary to flip them onto the serving dish, with the grilled side on top.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 11:</strong></li>
    <p>Enjoy with soy sauce or your preferred dipping sauce.</p>
</ul>
