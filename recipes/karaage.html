    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frying oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of sesame oil</li>
        <li>30 g of ginger</li>
        <li>600 g of chicken</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of sake</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of potato starch</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong></li>
        <p>In a pot of boiling water, place the meat. The slices should be thin. Remove the meat from the water as soon as it loses its red color; do not let it boil for too long. Set aside.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong></li>
        <p>In a pan heated over medium heat, add sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Mix. When the sauce starts to bubble, add the beef and coat it with the sauce.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong></li>
        <p>Before it evaporates, turn off the heat, remove the beef. Set aside.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong></li>
        <p>Place the rinsed rice in a rice cooker with a little less than two parts of water. Start the rice cooker.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong></li>
        <p>Add 100 mL of water and dashi to the sauce. Reheat over medium heat, incorporate the onion. Cover. When the sauce boils again, add the beef, mix, reduce the heat, and cover again for 5 minutes.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong></li>
        <p>Once everything is ready, place the rice in two bowls and top it with the beef, onion, and sauce.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong></li>
        <p>You can add a raw egg on top. When eating, mix the egg into the meat and the top layers of rice.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 8:</strong></li>
        <p><strong>Optional:</strong> It is possible to lightly cook the egg before adding it. To do this, bring a pot of water to a boil, remove it from the heat, and immerse the eggs. Keep them for 5 to 7 minutes, then remove and cool them in a bowl of very cold water. Crack the eggs: they should not be fully cooked; the white should remain fluid for a good mix.</p>
    
        <li><strong>Step 9:</strong></li>
        <p>It is also possible to increase the sauce proportions if you feel that the rice is not flavorful enough - but be careful not to drown the rice.</p>
    </ul>
