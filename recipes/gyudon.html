    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong></li>
    <p>Deflate the bag and close it. Then massage and ensure the flavor is well absorbed. Let it marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Remove excess air from the bag, seal it, and massage the chicken to ensure the flavors are absorbed. Allow it to marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</p>

    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong></li>

    <p>Remove the chicken, sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of flour and 3 tablespoons of potato starch. Mix and fry in oil heated to 160 degrees until the chicken starts to turn golden (about 3 minutes).

    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong></li>
    <p>Let it rest for 5-6 minutes, then fry again in oil heated to 180 degrees for about 1 to 2 minutes. Allow the chicken to rest for 5-6 minutes, then fry it again in oil at 180 degrees for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
